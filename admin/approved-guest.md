Dear Guest,

Thank you for agreeing to join us on Open Source Friday! We're excited to have you share your project with our community.

Your session will be hosted by Andrea Griffiths and/or Kedasha Kerr and will stream live on Twitch at 1 PM EST on your scheduled Friday. To get you set up:

1. Please select an upcoming Friday from our streaming calendar: [calendar link](https://gh.io/osf-booking)

2. After selecting your date, please open an issue titled:
   "Open Source Friday - [Your Project Name] - [DD-MM-YYYY]".
   using our guest template at this [issue link](https://gh.io/osf-issue).

Once both steps are completed, we'll send you additional details about the stream setup and what to expect.

Looking forward to having you on the show!

With gratitude,

Andrea and Kedasha
