Subject: Invitation to Participate in GitHub's Open Source Friday APAC! 🚀

Hey [Maintainer name],

We’re amped up for the upcoming Open Source Friday stream and would be thrilled to have you as our featured guest. Open Source Friday is our relaxed stream where we delve into the open source code-scape and exchange some fresh insights. 🌐

Here’s the simple rundown on how we'll work together:

1. First off, hit this [OSS Friday Calendar link](https://gh.io/osf-apac-cal) to book a slot that works for you. 🗓️
2. Next, pop over to our [repo](https://github.com/githubevents/open-source-friday-apac/issues) and create an issue with what you're keen on chatting about. 📝
3. Our friendly bot will nudge you to book a slot if you haven't yet, and once you do, we’ll mark your issue as "scheduled". ✅
4. That label triggers a task list on our end, ensuring everything sails smoothly on the big day. 📋
5. You’ll get a comment with stream instructions and other tidbits to prep you for the event. 🎥
6. Come event day, we’ll drop the Streamyard link in the issue for you to hop on board and join the conversation. 🛳️

Feel free to ping us if you have any questions or need more details on anything! Looking forward to some great code chatter with you.

Warm regards,

Karan MV and Yashraj Nayak
