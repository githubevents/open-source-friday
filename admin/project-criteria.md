## Open Source Friday APAC

We are very grateful for your interest in participating in our Open Source Friday APAC live streaming program! This initiative aims to showcase exciting open source projects and help grow their contributor communities.

To be considered for the program, your project should meet the following criteria:

1. Have a code of conduct, license and contributing guide in place.
2. Have a minimum of 100 stars and be hosted on GitHub.
3. Be open to new contributions from the greater developer community.

Additionally, projects with the following characteristics will be given preference:

- A community conversation channel (e.g., Discussion, Discord, or similar)
- A triage team or structured contributor onboarding process

As a maintainer or contributor, you should be:

1. Available to participate in the live stream on the designated Friday at 4 PM IST / 6:30 PM SGT. We're also happy to accommodate exceptions for pre-recording sessions for certain projects.
2. Willing to receive and review the show notes and live streaming preparation guide.
3. Available for a live stream scheduled at least two weeks in advance.

If your project meets these criteria and you're excited to showcase your work to a global audience, we'd love to have you on the show!
